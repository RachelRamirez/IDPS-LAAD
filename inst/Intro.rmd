## Introduction

This shiny gadget is designed to construct an Autoencoder Neural Network (ANN) to detect anomalous data observations within a dataset. This analytic will test multiple ANN hyperparameters to determine the optimal settings supporting anomaly detection.

## Current Limitations

* Data Preperation
  + 
  + 

* Hyperparameter DOE

* Test Hyperparameters

* Plot Outliers
